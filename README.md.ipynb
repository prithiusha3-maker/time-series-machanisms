    "# Advanced Time Series Forecasting using Attention-machanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project uses an attention-based transformer model (PyTorch) for multi-feature time series forecasting, as per assignment requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "- File: timeseries_dataset.csv\n",
    "- Features: Cars_Distributed, Cash_Incentive (expandable to 5+ features)\n",
    "- Rows: 120 (extend to 1000 for complete assignment)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. Data simulated and saved as timeseries_dataset.csv.\n",
    "2. Data is windowed for sequence modeling.\n",
    "3. Transformer model is constructed and trained on windowed data.\n",
    "4. Forecasts next 20 days beyond training data.\n",
    "5. Performance metrics (RMSE, MAE) are reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "- Make sure Python 3.8+ and required packages (PyTorch, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib) are installed.\n",
    "- Run `attention_transformer.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "- Output plot shows historical data and future predictions.\n",
    "- RMSE, MAE metrics printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files\n",
    "- timeseries_dataset.csv : dataset.\n",
    "- attention_transformer.py : complete script.\n",
    "- README.md : this documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- Expand features and data length as per assignment instructions.\n",
    "- Add model comparison and hyperparameter optimization for extra marks."
